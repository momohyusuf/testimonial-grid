                    I've been looking to make a transition and have heard people
                    who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro 
                    course and found it incredibly amazing here!
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and 
                    most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course,

                        <p class="testimony">"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a fine code. 
                        I needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn programming
                        step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formmer student theirs who can only
                         say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                        and staff did not dissappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The agile team product in particular, 
                        was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                         way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often reffered to it during interviews
                        as an example of my developement exprience. 
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack deveeloper 
                        after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!."</p>
